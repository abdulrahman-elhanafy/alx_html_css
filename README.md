# CSS Basic â€“ ALX Front-End Track

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Specialization**.

It introduces basic CSS concepts, including styling, layout using Flexbox, and responsive web design.


## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Summary

### 0. Some early styling
- Created `base.css` with a full reset and base styles.
- Linked `base.css` and `styles.css` in both HTML files (`<head>` tag).
- Created an empty `styles.css`.

### 1. Positioning
- Applied **Flexbox** layout:
  - `body` is a column flex container.
  - `main` is a row flex container.
  - `article` takes 2/3 of the space, `aside` takes 1/3.
  - Enabled scroll with `overflow-y: auto`.

### 2. Responsive Web Design
- Added `class="works_on_smartphone"` to `<body>` for mobile responsiveness.
- Added the required `<meta name="viewport">` tag to support mobile scaling.

### 3. Some More Styling
- Customized additional styles inside `styles.css`.
- Added a logo using Unicode character inside the `<header>` list.
- Maintained layout integrity (Flexbox only).
