# 🎧 Headphones Landing Page

A fully responsive landing page for a headphones brand, built **from scratch** using only HTML & CSS (and minimal JavaScript for the hamburger menu).  
The goal was to **replicate a given Figma design** while applying best practices in HTML structure, CSS styling, accessibility, and responsive design.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Smooth hover/active states for buttons and links
- A functional hamburger menu for mobile screens
